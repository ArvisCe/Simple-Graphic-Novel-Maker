# Simple graphic novel maker!

## this is very simple js / html / css code, but don't touch anything unless you know what you are doing!


### this is how it works:
#### Step 1: download the repository and put on your desktop
#### Step 2: go to display.html and open it so it opens in the browser
#### you will see the test scenes so you know what they look like.
#### Step 3: open scenes.js and look at how the creation process looks.
#### case number: is the scene you want to edit
#### setScreenImage(image_name) sets the background image
#### don't touch buttons = [];
#### buttons.push(button) is where a button is created with 2 values - the scene you will go to when its clicked and the text on it. Add as many as you want.
#### resetScreen(speaker, text, buttons); creates the whole scene, in the speaker field add the speaker, text field the text and nothing in the buttons, just leave it as buttons.

#### Sorry for the bad explenation. If anyone wants to, you can edit the existing styles and such.



#### Also the images folder just contains all of the images. Good luck!
